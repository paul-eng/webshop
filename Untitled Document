Use mongoose aggregate $facet to get subset of collection and total count in a single query

Infinite scroll done with transform of el in an overflow:hidden container, scrolling inside a container with overflow-x:scroll is possible, but scroll behavior smooth not consistent

ON mobile dont want to press buttons to trigger transforms when scrolling is preferred native navigation techinque, so disable transform buttons and use scroll snap,
trigger position reset w/ scrollleft after detecting reaching edges of container

later components use react hooks to manage internal state w better separation of concerns and less re-renders for irrelevant prop/state updates 

optional chaining, pseudoselectors pseudoelements

at enterprise level, use firebase auth, magento backend, formik validation

localstorage not the best
